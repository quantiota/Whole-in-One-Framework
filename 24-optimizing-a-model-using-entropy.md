## Abstract

In this article, we explore a novel approach to optimizing machine learning models by leveraging entropy as a guiding principle. We define a specific entropy functional and derive the gradients with respect to model parameters, providing a comprehensive framework for optimization. This approach offers insights into how entropy can be used to enhance model learning and adaptability.


## Introduction  

Entropy is a fundamental concept in information theory and statistical mechanics, representing the uncertainty or disorder in a system. In machine learning, entropy can be used to guide the optimization process, helping models to learn more flexible and robust representations of data. This article delves into the optimization of a model using a defined entropy functional, demonstrating how to compute gradients and update model parameters effectively.


## Entropy Expression

The entropy  $H$ is defined as:

$$
H = -\frac{1}{\ln 2} \int z \, dD
$$

where  $D = \displaystyle \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$ is the sigmoid function, and  $z$ is expressed as:

$$
z = \left( \sum_{j} (w_{ij} + G_{ij}) \cdot x_j + b_i \right)
$$

Here,  $w_{ij}$ ,  $G_{ij}$ , and  $b_i$ are the model parameters, and  $x_j$ represents the input features.


## Gradient Computation

To optimize the model, we need to compute the gradients of the entropy  $H$ with respect to the parameters  $w_{ij}$,  $G_{ij}$, and  $b_i$. Let's break down the computation step by step.

### Gradient with Respect to  $w_{ij}$ 

1. **Differentiate  H with Respect to  $w_{ij}$ **:

$$
\frac{\partial H}{\partial w_{ij}} = \frac{dH}{dz}\cdot \frac{\partial z}{\partial w_{ij}} 
= -\frac{1}{\ln2} \cdot z\,D(1-D) \cdot \frac{\partial z}{\partial w_{ij}}  
$$

2. **Compute  $\displaystyle \frac{\partial z}{\partial w_{ij}}$**:

$$
   \frac{\partial z}{\partial w_{ij}} = x_j
$$

3. **Substitute and Simplify**:

$$
\frac{\partial H}{\partial w_{ij}} = -\frac{1}{\ln2} \cdot z\,D(1-D) \cdot x_j 
$$

### Gradient with Respect to  $G_{ij}$ 

1. **Differentiate  H with Respect to  $G_{ij}$ **:

$$
\frac{\partial H}{\partial G_{ij}} = \frac{dH}{dz}\cdot \frac{\partial z}{\partial G_{ij}} 
= -\frac{1}{\ln2} \cdot z\,D(1-D)\cdot \frac{\partial z}{\partial G_{ij}}  
$$

2. **Compute  $\displaystyle \frac{\partial z}{\partial G_{ij}}$**:

$$
   \frac{\partial z}{\partial G_{ij}} = x_j
$$

3. **Substitute and Simplify**:

$$
\frac{\partial H}{\partial G_{ij}} = -\frac{1}{\ln2} \cdot z\,D(1-D)\cdot x_j 
$$


### Gradient with Respect to  $b_i$

1. **Differentiate  H with Respect to  $b_i$**:

$$
\frac{\partial H}{\partial b_{i}} = \frac{dH}{dz}\cdot \frac{\partial z}{\partial b_{i}} 
= -\frac{1}{\ln2} \cdot z\,D(1-D)\cdot \frac{\partial z}{\partial b_{i}}  
$$

2. **Compute  $\displaystyle \frac{\partial z}{\partial b_i}$**:

$$
   \frac{\partial z}{\partial b_i} = 1
$$

3. **Substitute and Simplify**:

$$
\frac{\partial H}{\partial b_{i}} = -\frac{1}{\ln2} \cdot z\,D(1-D)
$$


## Optimization Algorithm

The gradients derived above can be used in optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent, to update the model parameters and minimize the entropy  $H$. The update rules are:

$$
w_{ij} \leftarrow w_{ij} - \eta \frac{\partial H}{\partial w_{ij}}
$$

$$
G_{ij} \leftarrow G_{ij} - \eta \frac{\partial H}{\partial G_{ij}}
$$

$$
b_i \leftarrow b_i - \eta \frac{\partial H}{\partial b_i}
$$

where  $\eta$ is the learning rate.

## Comparison with Classical Entropy Gradient Approaches

The novel method presented in this article diverges from classical entropy gradient techniques in several key ways. The following points summarize the differences and the potential benefits of the new approach:

 **1. Entropy Functional vs. Error-Driven Loss:**

   - **New Method:**  
 
     The entropy is defined directly as a functional,  

$$
H = \displaystyle -\frac{1}{\ln 2} \int z dD
$$  


where the integration over the transformed activation $D$ emphasizes the role of uncertainty (or disorder) in the model. The optimization directly minimizes this entropy, capturing the system’s internal state.

   - **Classical Methods:**  
  
Traditional techniques, such as those using cross-entropy loss, focus on minimizing the divergence between predicted probabilities and actual labels. Here, the gradient is derived from the discrepancy between the output of a sigmoid (or softmax) function and the target values.

 **2. Parameter Incorporation:**

   - **New Method:**  
  
The approach incorporates two sets of parameters ($w_{ij}$) and ($G_{ij}$) in addition to the bias ($b_i$), all contributing additively to the activation ($z$). This dual-parameter structure provides an additional degree of freedom in modeling the system’s response, with gradients given by:

$$
 \frac{\partial H}{\partial w_{ij}} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial G_{ij}} = -\frac{1}{\ln2} \cdot z\,D(1-D) \cdot x_j, \quad \frac{\partial H}{\partial b_i} = -\frac{1}{\ln2} \cdot z\,D(1-D)
$$

   - **Classical Methods:**  
  
 Typically, only one set of weights (and the bias) is optimized, where the gradient reflects the error signal based on the difference between the predicted probability ($\sigma(z)$) and the true label. The parameters are updated to minimize a loss that directly measures prediction error rather than system entropy.

 **3. Role of the Sigmoid Function:**

   - **New Method:**  
  
The sigmoid function ($D = \displaystyle \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$) is integrated into the entropy functional, ensuring that the gradients capture the full influence of the activation’s distribution on the entropy. This integration provides a direct measure of how changes in the parameters affect the system's uncertainty.

   - **Classical Methods:**  
  
In conventional settings, the sigmoid is used primarily to convert the linear combination of inputs into probabilities. The gradient with respect to the loss (e.g., cross-entropy) involves terms like ($\sigma(z) - y$), which primarily reflect prediction errors rather than a broader measure of system uncertainty.

 **4. Conceptual Focus:**

   - **New Method:**  
  
The focus is on optimizing the entropy, which can lead to more adaptable and robust learning, particularly in scenarios where capturing the inherent uncertainty is crucial. This method provides a direct mechanism for tuning model parameters based on how they influence the overall disorder of the system.

   - **Classical Methods:**  
  
The conventional approach focuses on aligning the model's predictions with the target labels, where the gradient is driven by minimizing a discrepancy between two probability distributions. This can be effective in many settings but may not fully exploit the underlying uncertainty in the data.






In summary, while both the new and classical methods utilize gradient-based optimization, the new approach emphasizes the minimization of a defined entropy functional. This offers a fresh perspective by directly integrating uncertainty into the optimization process, potentially enhancing model performance in environments where traditional error-based methods might overlook subtle but significant dynamics.



## Conclusion

By leveraging entropy as a guiding principle, this novel approach offers a flexible and robust framework for optimizing machine learning models. The gradients with respect to the parameters  $w_{ij}$,  $G_{ij}$, and  $b_i$ provide a clear direction for updating the model to minimize entropy, enhancing its adaptability and performance. This method can be particularly useful in scenarios where traditional loss functions may not capture the underlying uncertainty or complexity of the data. Further exploration and validation of this approach through empirical studies and theoretical analysis can provide deeper insights into its potential applications and benefits.
